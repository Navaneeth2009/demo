1. Explain in detail about Software Development Processes
A software process is a structured set of activities required to develop a software system. The four fundamental software process activities are:

Software Specification – Defining the software and operational constraints.

Software Development – Designing and programming the software.

Software Validation – Ensuring the software meets requirements.

Software Evolution – Modifying software to reflect changing needs.

These activities are organized differently in various development models like waterfall, incremental, or agile.

General issues affecting software development:

Heterogeneity (variety of systems and devices),

Business/social changes,

Security and trust, and

Scale (from embedded to cloud systems).

2. Discuss about the Ethics of a Software Developer
Software engineering ethics are governed by professionalism, honesty, and responsibility. Key ethical principles include:

Confidentiality – Respecting employer/client data confidentiality.

Competence – Avoid misrepresenting your skills.

Intellectual Property Rights – Adhering to copyright and patent laws.

Computer Misuse – Not using technical skills for harm (e.g., malware, hacking).

Engineers should avoid activities that bring disrepute to the profession and always act with integrity.

3. Write about the Generic Software Development Models - Plan-Driven, Incremental and Integration and Configuration
Plan-Driven (Waterfall)
Follows a strict sequence: specification → development → validation → evolution. It is suitable when requirements are stable and well understood.

Incremental Development
Combines specification, development, and validation iteratively. The system is built in increments, each adding functionality. Easier feedback and early delivery.

Integration and Configuration
Uses existing reusable components. Focuses on configuring and integrating them for new systems. Highly dependent on component availability and compatibility.

4. Write in detail about Waterfall Model including Advantages and Disadvantages
Phases of Waterfall Model:

Requirements Analysis

System & Software Design

Implementation & Unit Testing

Integration & System Testing

Operation & Maintenance

Advantages:

Well-defined stages.

Suitable for systems with clear, fixed requirements.

Easy to manage and document.

Disadvantages:

Not flexible to change.

Poor for rapid or iterative development.

Late detection of design issues or requirement mismatches.

Suitable for:

Embedded systems.

Critical systems requiring rigorous documentation.

Large-scale systems built by multiple partners.

5. Write in detail about Spiral Model with Advantages and Disadvantages
Proposed by Barry Boehm, Spiral Model combines iterative development (like prototyping) with systematic aspects of waterfall.

Four Phases of Each Cycle:

Objective Setting – Define goals and constraints.

Risk Assessment & Reduction – Identify and evaluate risks.

Development & Validation – Prototyping, simulation, testing.

Planning – Decide next phase and plan further development.

Advantages:

Excellent for risk analysis.

Suitable for large, complex, high-risk projects.

Allows iterative refinement.

Disadvantages:

Expensive.

Requires skilled risk assessment.

Not ideal for small projects.

6. What is Agile Technique? Write about Agile Manifesto
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery.

Agile Manifesto Values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

Working software over comprehensive documentation.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

Responding to change over following a plan.

Key Principles:

Customer involvement

Incremental delivery

People over process

Embrace change

Maintain simplicity

7. Explain Extreme Programming (XP)
XP is a popular agile method that promotes frequent releases in short development cycles to improve productivity and responsiveness.

Key Practices:

Incremental Planning – Requirements on story cards.

Small Releases – Frequent and useful deliveries.

Simple Design – No overdesigning.

Test-First Development – Write tests before code.

Refactoring – Continuous code improvement.

Pair Programming – Two developers per workstation.

Collective Ownership – Everyone can modify any part.

Continuous Integration – All code tested and integrated.

On-site Customer – Customer part of the team.

8. Explain SCRUM
Scrum is an agile framework focused on iterative development and team collaboration.

Three Phases:

Planning Phase – Define goals and architecture.

Sprint Cycles – Each sprint (2–4 weeks) builds a system increment.

Closure Phase – Final review, documentation, and lessons.

Scrum Terms:

Product Backlog – List of work items.

Sprint – Iteration cycle (2–4 weeks).

Scrum – Daily team meeting.

Scrum Master – Facilitator who shields team from distractions.

Product Owner – Prioritizes features, represents users.

Potentially Shippable Product Increment – Finished software each sprint.

Velocity – Measure of work completed in a sprint.

Benefits:

Fast delivery of useful features.

Adapts to change quickly.

Encourages team transparency and communication.
